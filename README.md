# Script in python for converting videos into audio and back
The goal is to approximate analog video synthesis techniques where audio effects can be applied to the (encoded) video signal in order to create various lo-fi effects when returning it to video/mp4 form

# Create audio file using "output_video.mp4" as input
python3 videoToAudio.py
-> Output = video_encoded_audio.wav

# Apply any effects to the audio (not tested yet)

# Create video from the audio file
python3 audioToVideo.py
